Hi [RECRUITER NAME]!

I'm contacting you today to extend [COMPANY NAME] the opportunity to officially be a sponsor at MadHacks - Madison's first premier 36-hour, MLH-sanctioned hackathon!

As you may know, we have successfully hosted small hackathons in the past with the help of local area businesses and startups. It is our hope to continue growing the hackathon community here at UW-Madison - and that starts with acquiring funding to support our hackers.

We have carefully debated our sponsorship offerings. With the help of MLH coaches, HackMIT, and HackIllinois administrators, we have created the following list of tiers: http://madhacks.org/pdf/sponsorship.pdf. Please note, we are willing to take in-kind donations in order for sponsors to reach a desired tier level - the value of which can be discussed.

Unlike other hackathons, MadHacks is going to be putting emphasis on the wacky, the original, and the downright impossible! Like the mad-genius computer scientists before us, we want to test our boundaries like never before. For sponsors, this means being able to reach out to the highly dedicated risk-takers, the envelope pushers, and the daredevils. We hope to produce a new kind of hackathon: where the winners are chosen by the hackers, and the sponsors feel like they are right in the middle of the hacker community itself - rather than looking in.

We hope we can arrange a time to talk in more detail about this year's attendees, as well as our hopes for MadHacks in the future.

Please feel free to reach out to our team at anytime to arrange a meeting, or to Katie Anderson at Katie.Anderson@MadHacks.org - our sponsor liaison.

Thank you for your time,
