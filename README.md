Super quick script written for MadHacks 2015 sponsor email generation.

To use:
python main.py

Invariants:
-Must have python 2.7 (might work with 3? no idea)
-Must have "sponsors.csv" file in the data/ folder
-Must have "template.txt" in the root directory

Let me know if there are any issues, or fork+fix. Thanks!
